Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

# In[59]:



new_list = []
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7 == 0 != i%5:
        new_list.append(i)
print(new_list)

        


# In[3]:


first_name = input(str("First Name : " ))
last_name = input(str("Last_name : " ))

print(last_name, first_name)


# In[1]:


r = 12/2
v = (4/3) * 3.14 * (r **3)


print("volume of the sphere is : ", v)
